<p><strong>8 Premium Android Apps to Get Unlimited VPN for&nbsp;FREE</strong></p>
<small> </small><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></div>
<div class="entry">
<p>The full form of VPN is Virtual Private Network. In simple words, it means a virtual network in which the user remains anonymous and remains untraceable from the <em><strong>website trackers</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Using VPN, you can change your ip address to any other ip address.</p>
<p>By default, an ip address can be used to determine the location of the user he is browsing from.</p>
<p>Hence, the ability to change ip address enables you to change your location to virtually any place in the world.</p>
<p>That is why this is called Virtual Private Network. You may be browsing from your home but you can choose any location around the world as your browsing location.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;has many important uses due to it&rsquo;s advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Features and Advantages of using VPN:</strong></p>
<p>Hides your original IP Address and Changes IP Address so that you can surf anonymously.<br /> Unblocks any websites blocked by your ISP, Administrators or by law or court orders.<br /> Protects your identity over a Wi-Fi Network so that hackers cannot get into your private files.<br /> Protects you from visiting sites having Malwares.<br /> Helps to browse Google Play without country restrictions to download unavailable apps in your country.<br /> <strong>Tricks to Get Unlimited Free VPN:</strong></p>
<p>Well, before I jump into the main article, let me clarify this, there are two ways to enjoy unlimited free vpn, the ethical and the unethical ways.</p>
<p>The ethical ways includes services that are provided for free and will remain free forever.</p>
<p>The unethical ways are those whose services are by default not free but have been modified and unlocked so that the premium services can be used without paying for them.</p>
<p>We are sharing both the ways for you here, it is entirely your decision which to choose and to stick on.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend using the ethical ones, and also suggest you to buy their premium services to support them.<br /> 100% Free to Use VPN Apps with Limited Features:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the 100% Free VPN Services first.</p>
<p>Use <em><strong>Super</strong></em>:</p>
<p>This VPN app is a simple app with minimum modifications or settings. Just install and run. Each session is of 60 minutes after that you have to manually renew the session for free with just a click of a button.</p>
<p>Use <em><strong>Cloud Unlimited</strong></em>:</p>
<p>CloudVPN is yet another app just like SuperVPN that you can use for accessing Free and Unlimited VPN Service. It has a one click connection button to connect to their servers.</p>
<p>Use <em><strong>Flash Free Proxy App</strong></em>:</p>

FlashVPN servers are available on USA, England and Japan to give you more privacy.</p>
