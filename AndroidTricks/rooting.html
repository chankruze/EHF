<p><strong>About Rooting Phones</strong></p>
<p>Rooting is a process that allows you to attain root access to the Android operating system code (the equivalent term for Apple devices id jailbreaking). It gives you privileges to modify the software code on the device or install other software that the manufacturer wouldn&rsquo;t normally allow you to. And for good mobile security reasons: they don&rsquo;t want users to make modifications to the phones that could result in accidents beyond repair; it is easier for them to offer support if they allow users to only use the same unmodified version of the software. But tech savvy users have already developed rooting methods, which vary depending on device. They are available on the web, and more and more Android users are resorting to them because of the powerful perks they provide, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;full customization for just about every theme/graphic</li>
<li>download of any app, regardless of the app store they&rsquo;re posted on</li>
<li>extended battery life and added performance</li>
<li>updates to the latest version of Android if your device is outdated and no longer updated by the manufacturer</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;But if you do it improperly, it can create havoc. And even done properly, if your phone doesn&rsquo;t have proper antivirus protection for Android, rooting leaves your device open to all sorts of malware.</p>
