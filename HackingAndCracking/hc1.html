<p><strong>What is Dark Net?</strong></p>
<p>You may have heard that there is some mysterious hidden internet called the &lsquo;Deep Web&rsquo; or the &lsquo;DarkNet&rsquo; that you can&rsquo;t get to from Google, and which is hidden from most web surfers.</p>
<p>Perhaps tales of the dark marketplaces selling all kinds of legal and illicit goods anonymously for Bitcoin have picqued your curiosity, and you would like to take a look around and see what they are like.</p>
<p>Perhaps you live in a country where social media and ordinary internet sites are censored and you would like to visit a place where everyone is free to speak their mind freely and without fear of repurcussion.</p>
  
  </div>
<div class="para">
<p><strong>Use of Darknet:</strong></p>
<p>A DarkNet is a private network. The internet, at its base, it a bunch of computers connected together.</p>
<p>Usually we can connect to any computer we want to &ndash; we just need to know its address, in the form of an IP address or the familiar website addresses which are mapped to them.</p>
<p>In a darknet you maintain a list of trusted friends, and your computer can only connect to the people you know. This provides an even more private and secure corner of the internet than you can get from a deep web, but also a much more limited one.</p>
<p>Darknet and deep web technologies can be combined, as you will see below, to provide a balance of privacy and useability.</p>
  </div>
<div class="para">
<p><strong>How to Access DarkNet?</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, the deep web is not a single location, but a whole class of different locations which share one thing in common &ndash; that they are hidden from search engines and regular internet users.</p>
<p>Different areas of the deep web therefore have different requirements for you to be able to access them, and any technology which you use will only give you access to its specific area of the hidden internet.</p>
<p>Having said that, there is a very small number of technologies used to create what is popularly called the &lsquo;deep web&rsquo; or &lsquo;darknet&rsquo;, and one in particular which the vast majority of people use &ndash; TOR.</p>

<p><strong>How to Check if An Email Address Is Valid Or Not!!</strong></p>
<p>Just enter the email address and hit check button.</p>
<p>Then it tells you whether the email address is real or not.</p>
<p>It extracts the MX records from the email address and connect to mail server (over SMTP and also simulates sending a message) to make sure the mailbox really exist for that user/address.</p>

<p><strong>How to Move Emails from One Gmail Account to Another</strong></p>
<p>First, make sure all email programs or services you have configured to download mail from your old Gmail account using POP are closed or set not to check mail automatically. Then, to move (or copy) all received and sent emails from one Gmail account to another Gmail account by having the new Gmail account fetch the messages:</p>
<p>1.Log i​n to the account from which you want to import (bring over) mail.<br /> 2.Click the Settings gear icon (⚙️) in the Gmail account's toolbar.<br /> 3.Select Settings from the menu that comes up.<br /> 4.Go to the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab.<br /> 5.Select Enable POP for all mail (even mail that's already been downloaded) under POP Download: regardless of the current POP download status (under Status:).</p>
<p>Note: You do not have to move messages to the old account's inbox for the new account to pick them up. Archived mail will be fetched and copied to the new account automatically.</p>
<p>6.Select archive Gmail's copy under When messages are accessed with POP to have your old account's inbox cleared; select delete Gmail's copy instead to move mail instead of copying it.</p>
<p>Tips: If you do want to retain some messages at the old account, they will be available in the Trash label for 30 days.<br /> You can also select keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox (unread) or mark Gmail's copy as read, of course.</p>
<p>7.Click Save Changes.<br /> 8.Click your picture (or the icon) in Gmail's top right corner.<br /> 9.Select Sign out from the menu that appears.</p>

<p><strong>Everything About Tor:What is Tor? How Tor Works</strong></p>
<p>Tor is based on the principle of &lsquo;onion routing&rsquo; which was developed by Paul Syverson, Michael G. Reed and David Goldschlag at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in the 1990&rsquo;s. <br />The alpha version of Tor, named &lsquo;The Onion Routing Project&rsquo; or simply TOR Project, was developed by Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson. <br />It was launched on September 20, 2002. Further development was carried under the financial roof of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).</p>
<p>Tor works on the concept of &lsquo;onion routing&rsquo; method in which the user data is first encrypted and then transferred through different relays present in the Tor network, thus creating a multi-layered encryption (layers like an onion), thereby keeping the identity of the user safe.</p>
