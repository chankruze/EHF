<p><strong>How to Use Your Phone as a Webcam</strong></p>
<p>Install a copy of IP Webcam on your Android device. Next, you'll need to install a copy of its software, IP Camera Adapter, on Windows. You will also need to have either Chrome or Firefox on your computer, as this application does not work well with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the IP Webcam app on your Android device and make the necessary adjustments for resolution, quality, orientation, and FPS limit. After you're finished, scroll to the bottom and tap on Start Server.</p>
<p>Step 2: Head to the IP address that appears at the bottom of the screen on your Android device in Chrome or Firefox. Make sure you include the port shown on the screen as well.</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose the option that best suits your needs; I recommend "Use browser built-in viewer."</p>
<p>Step 4: Open the IP Camera Adapter application you installed on Windows. Then, fill in the required information, such as IP, port (and don't forget the /videofeed on that address), username, and password.</p>
<p>Step 5: Click Autodetect next to the resolution settings, and then Apply. Now you'll need to restart any application you want to use the Webcam with, like Skype.</p>

<p><strong>The most secure way to encrypt and hide your files</strong></p>
<p>Here, I am going to show you how to hide, encrypt and secure your data everywhere you go.<br /> We will be using a free and open Source tool called Truecrypt.</p>
<p>Truecrypt is an incredible Software which does an extremely good job of encrypting your data. Truecrypt encryption is thought to be unbreakable, even the FBI hackers can't break it. There are many ways to configure truecrypt, but here I will be discussing the simplest and most convenient Way.</p>
<p>HoW to use truecrypt to encrypt your files and folders? We Will Create a file container"much like a Secure Vault, You can decide the size of this vault. This vault is a single file and can have any extension and you can transfer it anywhere you like. You can open the vault by opening it with truecrypt and entering the password. So, lets get started</p>
<p>1. Open truecrypt and click on Create Volume <br />2. Leave the default and Click next <br />3. Leave the default and click Next <br />4. Click Select File <br />5. Anywhere in your hard drive, just type any file name you want your container to be. Here its myfile.txt <br />Note that.txt is just an extension, and it doesn't have any meaning in this regard. The idea is that people Will think its a mere txt file.</p>
<p>6.Leave the default and Click next <br />7. Enter the desired size of the container and click next. I've made mine 3GB. Note that you cannot change the size of the container afterwards. <br />8. Create a strong password for your container. Note that the only way to crack truecrypt is to brute force it. So, if your password is at least 15 or 20 characters with all the special characters etc, it should theoretically be impossible to break. <br />9. Move your mouse around a bit, and click Format. it may take sometime depending on your CPU power. After the format is complete, close the window. <br />10. Next, click on any drive in the list. I've clicked drive d. After that Select the file We Created earlier, myfile.txt. And finally click on Mount. <br />11 Once you press mount, it will ask for the password you set earlier. Click Ok and you are done.</p>
