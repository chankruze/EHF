<p><strong>What is zero-day attack?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few common, but slightly different definitions of zero-day attacks. Some define zero-day attacks as attacks on vulnerabilities that have not been patched or made public, while others define them as attacks that take advantage of a security vulnerability on the same day that the vulnerability becomes publicly known (zero-day).</p>
<p>Software vulnerabilities may be discovered by hackers, by security companies or researchers, by the software vendors themselves, or by users. If discovered by hackers, an exploit will be kept secret for as long as possible and will circulate only through the ranks of hackers, until software or security companies become aware of it or of the attacks targeting it. These types of attacks are defined by some as 'less than zero-day' attacks.</p>

<p><strong>What is DNS hijacking?</strong></p>
<p>DNS hijacking is a type of malicious attack in which an individual redirects queries to a domain name server (DNS), by overriding a computer's TCP/IP settings. ... Once the individual or individuals performing the DNS hijacking have control of the DNS, they can use it to direct traffic to different websites.</p>

<p><strong>What is Packet injection?</strong></p>
<p>Packet injection (also known as forging packets or spoofing packets) is a computer networking term that refers to the process of interfering with an established network connection, by means of constructing packets to appear as if they are part of the normal communication stream.</p>
<p>The packet injection process allows an unknown third party to disrupt or intercept packets from the consenting parties that are communicating, which can lead to degradation or blockage of users' ability to utilize certain network services or protocols. Packet injection is commonly used in man-in-the-middle attacks and denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<p><strong>What is Clickjacking Attacks?</strong></p>
<p>common and hugely destructive example of this technique could be when an attacker who builds a website that has a button on it that says &ldquo;Click here for to enter the contest&ldquo;. However, just beside the button, they put in an almost invisible frame that links to the &lsquo;Delete all contacts&rsquo; of your Gmail account&rsquo;. The victim tries to click on the button but instead actually clicks on the invisible button. Hence, the attacker has &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; the user&rsquo;s &ldquo;click&rdquo;, and hence the name Clickjacking.</p>
<p>In recent times, Clickjacking has made its way to popular services including Adobe Flash Player and Twitter. Some attackers altered the Adobe Flash plugin settings. By loading this page into an invisible iframe, an attacker could trick a user into altering the security settings of Flash, giving permission for any Flash animation to utilize the computer&rsquo;s microphone and camera.</p>

<p><strong>What is DNS Cache Poisoning?</strong></p>
<p>DNS cache poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is a type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the domain name system (DNS) to divert Internet traffic away from legitimate servers and towards fake ones.</p>
<p>One of the reasons DNS poisoning is so dangerous is because it can spread from DNS server to DNS server. In 2010, a DNS poisoning event resulted in the Great Firewall of China temporarily escaping China&rsquo;s national borders, censoring the Internet in the USA until the problem was fixed.</p>
