<p><strong>What's Hack ,Hacking and Hacker?</strong></p>
<p>the only meaning that hack held for me in regard to computers was as a verb meaning &ldquo;to illegally enter a computer system.&rdquo; I too was surprised to come across headlines like the following:</p>
<p>How did hack go from &ldquo;illegal computer activity&rdquo; to &ldquo;a tip for making things easier to do&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Looking a little further, I find that hack and hacking to connote only malicious unauthorized access to computer files may reflect general usage, but not that of programmers who are proud to be known as &ldquo;hackers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OED has ten entries for the word hack: five as a noun, four as a verb, and one as a combining form.</p>
<p>The verb hack in the sense of &ldquo;to cut with heavy blows&rdquo; has been in the language since the early 13th century, but the use of hack in the context of computer programming dates from the 1970s.</p>
<p>Note: Hack in the sense of &ldquo;to cope with&rdquo; dates from 1955: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hack all this extra work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The etymology of the computer term hack is not certain. According to one theory, it derives from the noun hack used as tech slang for &ldquo;one who works like a hack at writing and experimenting with software, one who enjoys computer programming for its own sake.&rdquo; (OnlineEtymologyDictionary).</p>
<p>Hacking, as the practice of gaining illegal or unauthorized access to other people&rsquo;s computers is called.</p>
<p>Because hack, hacker, and hacking have such varied connotations, writers should consider the intended audience when using them.</p>
<p>In the programming community, hacker and hacking are good things, or at least neutral. Using an adjective to describe the bad kind might be useful when writing for programmers, for example, &ldquo;malicious hacking&rdquo; or &ldquo;illegal hacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the noun hack meaning &ldquo;tip,&rdquo; &ldquo;suggestion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;work-around,&rdquo; I expect the usage will become embedded in computer-speak.</p>
<p>The trendy use of hack in the context of cooking, parenting, and other non-computer-related fields, however, will probably eventually revert to tip or suggestion.</p>
