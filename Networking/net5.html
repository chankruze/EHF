<p><strong>What is spidering.?</strong></p>
<p>A spider is a program that visits Web sites and reads their pages and other information in order to create entries for a search engine index.</p>
<p>The major search engines on the Web all have such a program, which is also known as a "crawler" or a "bot." Spiders are typically programmed to visit sites that have been submitted by their owners as new or updated. Entire sites or specific pages can be selectively visited and indexed.</p>
<p>Spiders are called spiders because they usually visit many sites in parallel at the same time, their "legs" spanning a large area of the "web." Spiders can crawl through a site's pages in several ways. One way is to follow all the hypertext links in each page until all the pages have been read.</p>

<p><strong>What does Vulnerability mean?</strong></p>
<p>Vulnerability is a cyber-security term that refers to a flaw in a system that can leave it open to attack. A vulnerability may also refer to any type of weakness in a computer system itself, in a set of procedures, or in anything that leaves information security exposed to a threat.</p>
<p>Both black hats and white hats regularly search for vulnerabilities and test exploits, however, and if a cybercriminal finds a useful and unreported security hole, he is likely to take advantage of it. Proponents of disclosure maintain that it leads to more patching of vulnerabilities and more secure software.</p>

<p><strong>What Is Self-Destructing Messaging?</strong></p>
<p>Self-destructing messaging, otherwise known as 'ephemeral' messaging, is disappearing ink for text and photos.</p>
<p>All messages are purposely short-lived; the messaging system automatically erases the content minutes or seconds after the message is consumed.</p>
<p>This deletion happens on the receiver's device, the sender's device, and on the system servers. No lasting record of the conversation is kept.</p>
