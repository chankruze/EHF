<p><strong>What is an SMTP server?</strong></p>
<p>SMTP server is a machine, or collection of machines, whose primary purpose is to send, receive, and/or relay messages between email senders and receivers.</p>
<p>An SMTP server will have an address, or addresses, that can be set by the mail client or application that you are using, generally formatted as smtp.serveraddress.com.</p>

<p><strong>What is port ?</strong></p>
<p>In the internet protocol suite, a port is an endpoint of communication in an operating system. While the term is also used for female connectors on hardware devices (see computer port), in software it is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service.</p>
<p>A port is always associated with an IP address of a host and the protocol type of the communication, and thus completes the destination or origination network address of a communication session.</p>
<p>A port is identified for each address and protocol by a 16-bit number, commonly known as the port number. For example, an address may be "protocol: TCP, IP address: 1.2.3.4, port number: 80", which may be written 1.2.3.4:80 when the protocol is known from context.</p>
<p>Specific port numbers are often used to identify specific services. Of the thousands of enumerated ports, 1024 well-known port numbers are reserved by convention to identify specific service types on a host.</p>

<div class="para">
<p><strong>What is localhost?</strong></p>
<p>The localhost is the default name describing the local computer address also known as the loopback address.</p>
<p>For example, typing: ping localhost would ping the local IP address of 127.0.0.1 (the loopback address). When setting up a web server or software on a web server, 127.0.0.1 is used to point the software to the local machine.</p>

<div class="para">
<p><strong>What is FTP ?</strong></p>
<p>FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol. As the name suggests, FTP is used to transfer files between computers on a network.</p>
<p>You can use FTP to exchange files between computer accounts, transfer files between an account and a desktop computer, or access online software archives.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that many FTP sites are heavily used and require several attempts before connecting.</p>

<div class="para">
<p><strong>What is Telnet?</strong></p>
<p>Telnet is a user command and an underlying TCP/IP protocol for accessing remote computers. Through Telnet, an administrator or another user can access someone else's computer remotely.</p>
<p>On the Web, HTTP and FTP protocols allow you to request specific files from remote computers, but not to actually be logged on as a user of that computer. With Telnet, you log on as a regular user with whatever privileges you may have been granted to the specific application and data on that computer.</p>
