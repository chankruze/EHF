<p><strong>Top Operating Systems For Hackers </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kali Linux</strong>:&nbsp; Kali Linux is an advanced penetration testing tool that should be a part of every security professional&rsquo;s toolbox. Penetration testing involves using a variety of tools and techniques to test the limits of security policies and procedures. What Kali has done is collect just about everything you&rsquo;ll need in a single CD. It includes more than 300 different tools, all of which are open-source and available on GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Parrot Security OS :- </strong>Parrot Security is an operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux mixed with Frozen box OS and Kali Linux in order to provide the best penetration and security testing experience. it is an operating system for IT security and penetration testing developed by the Frozen box Dev Team. It is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian and mixed with Kali.<br />Parrot uses Kali repositories in order to take latest updates for almost all the tools, but it also has its own dedicated repository where all the custom packets are kept. This is why this distro is not just a simple Kali &ldquo;mod&rdquo; but an entire new concept which relies on Kali&rsquo;s tool repositories. As such, it introduces a lot of new features and different developing choices.Parrot uses MATE as a Desktop Environment. The lightweight and powerful interface is derived from famous Gnome 2, and thanks to FrozenBox highly customizable with captivating icons, ad-hoc themes, and wallpapers. System look is proposed and designed by the community members and also members of Frozen box Network, who are closely following the development of this project.</li>
<li><strong>BackBox Linux :- </strong>BackBox is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. It has been developed to perform penetration tests and security assessments. Designed to be fast, easy to use and provide a minimal yet complete desktop environment, thanks to its own software repositories, always being updated to the latest stable version of the most used and best known ethical hacking tools.</li>
<li><strong>Samurai Web Testing Framework:</strong> The Samurai Web Testing Framework is a live Linux environment that has been pre-configured to function as a web pen-testing environment. The CD contains the best of the open source and free tools that focus on testing and attacking websites. In developing this environment, we have based our tool selection on the tools we use in our security practice. We have included the tools used in all four steps of a web pen-test.</li>
<li><strong>NodeZero Linux :-</strong> Penetration testing and security auditing requires specialist tools.The natural path leads us to collecting them all in one handy place. However how that collection is implemented can be critical to how you deploy effective and robust testing.<br />All though NodeZero Linux can be used as a &ldquo;Live System&rdquo; for occasional testing, its real strength comes from the understanding that a tester requires a strong and efficient system. This is achieved in our belief by working at a distribution that is a permanent installation, that benefits from a strong selection of tools, integrated with a stable Linux environment.</li>
<li><strong>Ubuntu Linux:-</strong> Ubuntu Linux distribution is a most famous distribution for Linux. There are many variants of Ubuntu available on the internet. This is Debian based Linux operating system for PC. You can also run this os on your android mobile.</li>
<li><strong>DEFT :-</strong> Deft is Ubuntu customization with a collection of computer forensic programs and documents created by thousands of individuals, teams and companies. Each of these works might come under a different licence. There Licence Policy describe the process that we follow in determining which software we will ship and by default on the deft install CD.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Bugtraq :-</strong>Bugtraq is an electronic mailing list dedicated to issues about computer security. On-topic issues are new discussions about vulnerabilities, vendor security-related announcements, methods of exploitation, and how to fix them. It is a high-volume mailing list, and almost all new vulnerabilities are discussed there.
<p>Bugtraq team is experienced freaks and developers, It is available in Debian, Ubuntu and OpenSuSe in 32 and 64 bit architectures.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>BlackArc Linux :-</strong> This is the format of the <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">README.md</span> file in GitHub. You should be able to read and write a simple Markdown document. And that&rsquo;s easy because it has just seven symbols: <code>(#</code> is a header, <code>##</code> is a subheader, <code>*</code> is a bullet, <code>__</code> and <code>**</code> are bold, <code>_</code> and <code>*</code> are italics, <code>`</code> is monospace, and ---&nbsp;is a break or rule). Markdown editors often have extensions but those are the basics. From that basic markup language, you can get slides, PDFs, and HTML. Often these output formats can be consistently formatted with CSS or some other way. Best of all, you don&rsquo;t end up with smart quotes in your code samples.</li>
<li><strong>Network Security Toolkit (NST) :-</strong> Network Security Toolkit (NST) is a bootable live CD based on Fedora Core. The toolkit was designed to provide easy access to best-of-breed open source network security applications and should run on most x86 platforms. The main intent of developing this toolkit was to provide the network security administrator with a comprehensive set of open source network security tools.<br />What we find rather fascinating with NST is that we can transform most x86 systems (Pentium II and above) into a system designed for network traffic analysis, intrusion detection, network packet generation, wireless network monitoring, a virtual system service server, or a sophisticated network/host scanner.<br /><br /></li>
