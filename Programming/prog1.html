<p><strong>What is Script and Macro Viruses ?</strong></p>
<p>Script viruses (sometimes called macro viruses) generally travel embedded in email and office automation documents, although they can be found in web pages as well.</p>
<p>Old fashioned program viruses are usually implemented in executable system code, whereas script viruses are usually written in a powerful high-level language that is compiled and run on the fly.</p>
<p>They often have sophisticated functionality and direct interfaces to high level applications such as word processing, spreadsheet, email, and web programs, and can wreak considerable havoc.</p>
<p>Since they first surfaced in office automation programs, they are sometimes also called "macro" viruses. Script viruses can also propagate through IRC protocols.</p>

<p><strong>How to Use Windows 7 Without Activation</strong></p>
<p>You have to use the same slmgr -rearm command in this method too.</p>
<p>So here is the step-by-step method:</p>
<p>1. Click on "Start button -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories". Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run As Administrator". If you are prompted to enter password, enter the password and continue. You can also open Command Prompt in Administrator mode by typing "cmd" in Start Menu Search box and press "Ctrl+Shift+Enter".</p>
<p>2. Now provide following command:</p>
<p>slmgr -rearm</p>
<p>Extend_Windows_Vista_and_7_Trial_Period.png</p>
<p>3. You'll be prompted to restart Windows, restart it and the trial period will be reset to 30 days again.</p>
<p>4. You can use the same command 3 times. In this way you'll be able to use Windows for 120 days without activation.</p>
<p>5. Now its time for the main trick. Type regedit in RUN dialog box and press Enter. Now go to following key:</p>
<p>For Windows Vista:<br /> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\SL</p>
<p>For Windows 7:<br /> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform</p>
<p>6. In right-side pane, change value of SkipRearm to 1.</p>
<p>Extend_Windows_Vista_7_Trial_Period.png</p>
<p>7. Now you'll be able to use the slmgr -rearm command 8 more times. So you'll get total 360 days for using Vista and 7 without activation:</p>
<p>120 days by using slmgr -rearm command before registry editing</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>240 days after registry editing</p>
<p>||</p>
<p>360 days</p>
