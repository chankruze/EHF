<p><strong>What is C++ Programming Language ?</strong></p>
<p>C++ is one of the most popular languages primarily utilized with system/application software, drivers, client-server applications and embedded firmware.</p>
<p>The main highlight of C++ is a collection of predefined classes, which are data types that can be instantiated multiple times. The language also facilitates declaration of user-defined classes. Classes can further accommodate member functions to implement specific functionality. Multiple objects of a particular class can be defined to implement the functions within the class. Objects can be defined as instances created at run time. These classes can also be inherited by other new classes which take in the public and protected functionalities by default.</p>

<p><strong>What Is Object-oriented programming (OOP) ?</strong></p>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.</p>
