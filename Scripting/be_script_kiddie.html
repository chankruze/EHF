<p><strong>Ways to Become the Ultimate Script Kiddie</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You do not need to learn C, C++, C#, Python, Perl, PHP, Assembly and other computer programming languages since Kali, Parrot OS, and Backbox Linux have scripts and GUIs for performing penetration testing, wireless cracking, and vulnerability assessment.</li>
<li>Use r57, c100 or c99 shells as your backdoor shells as a proof that you were able to hack their web application and have gained access to the server.</li>
<li>Use the Hail Mary attack in Armitage in a covert penetration test because the GUI is awesome. It is very cool and totally legit. You don&rsquo;t need to know the exploits being launched.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to study exploit development or all those EIP and ESP stuffs since you can just download any exploits in Exploit-DB or Packet Storm. The Metasploit Framework has a bunch of exploits too so no worries. Some forums have exploit kits that are free to download and you should be all right with it.</li>
<li>Make unbelievable claims that you are the world&rsquo;s no. 1 hacker and write a book about your hack escapades and adventures.</li>
<li>Trust and use SubSeven, DarkComet RAT or Lost Door Remote Administration Tools (RAT).</li>
<li>Use wifite (automated wireless auditor), Gerix Wifi Cracker, WepAttack and Fern WiFi Cracker without having to know how to use Aircrack-ng Suite.</li>
<li>Use Burp Suite Professional&rsquo;s Active scanning always when auditing web apps &ndash; it&rsquo;s all about the threads. Also do not trust the Web Application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook &ndash; it takes time.</li>
<li>Treat Acunetix, Netsparker, HP Webinspect, Core Impact and IBM Appscan as your ultimate web application hacking tools.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to learn about networking, TCP/IP, and IPv6 since there are various GUI tools for automating network penetration testing and network pwnage. You don&rsquo;t need to be quiet in order to hear better, sometimes you need brute force if it just doesn&rsquo;t work out well.</li>
<li>Download as many hacking tools as you can. Fill up your hard drive with loads of it. Turn off your antivirus if it detects some of your tools as malicious.</li>
<li>Create your own security blog that rips off other articles from known InfoSec blogs.</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t hack a certain website with your tools, just suppress it by DDoSing their site. Sometimes you just need to annoy them in order to teach them instead of outsmarting them.</li>
<li>Create your own underground group then deface as many websites as you can with your group name on it like &ldquo;<em>Owned by fs0ciety! Nothing was harmed except your pride</em>&rdquo; without knowing what attacks you have conducted.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to understand the concepts of how an operating system works.</li>
<li>Create your own &ldquo;Self-Interview&rdquo; without being asked by a news editor and have it published online. Self-promotion is good so that you can spread how you started hacking and share the tools that you used.</li>
<li>Create an ub3rl33t handle with numbers in it e.g. 4h4ck3r, d1v1d3sbyz3r0, z3r0c00l, 3n1gm4, j3j3m0n, m4st3rsw0rd, k3rn3l 3.0, etc.</li>
<li>Do not resist the urge to use LOIC, WiNuke, Cain and Abel, Back Orifice, ProRat, exploit kits, Trojans, and malware without understanding how it works and its underlying concepts.</li>
<li>UNIX is just too old. You don&rsquo;t need to study it. You have Windows, anyway.</li>
<li>Do not contribute to open source tools like Metasploit, Nmap Scripts, SQLmap, and wpscan. Just use them anyway!</li>
<li>Do not responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities that you have found or do not submit vulnerability findings and exploits in PacketStorm and Exploit-DB.</li>
<li>Create an army of zombie computers and botnets by using available tools online. You can rip off some known malware in the wild.</li>
<li>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;Try Harder&rdquo; as what the Offensive Security Course always says. The easy way is better.</li>
<li>Threaten that you will hack people if they agitate you.</li>
<li>If you have problems installing penetration-testing distributions, just use Windows and download alternative packages and bundles for hacking.</li>
