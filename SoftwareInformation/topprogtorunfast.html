<p><strong>Top Programs That Can Make Your Computer Run Faster </strong></p>
<p><strong>MSConfig / Task Manager</strong></p>
<p>In theory, having lots of software on your computer probably isn&rsquo;t causing a slowdown by itself. When you have two dozen programs all trying to run when you first start the system, though, that&rsquo;s where problems occur. The built-in utility MSConfig can help you cut down on the amount of programs that run automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Disk Cleanup / CCleaner</strong></p>
<p>You might already know, but a lot of files on your computer aren&rsquo;t necessary for any program. From leftover Windows Update files to temporary data used by your web browser, you could have several gigabytes of junk just sitting around.If this is filling up your hard drive, it could affect performance.Your best two options for cleaning up temporary data are the built-in Disk Cleanup tool and CCleaner.</p>
<p><strong>Revo Uninstaller</strong></p>
<p>While it helps to prevent non-critical software from running at startup, it&rsquo;s even better to uninstall programs you don&rsquo;t use. This will free up space and save resources. You can always use the Programs and Features menu in Windows to uninstall software, but going a step further with Revo Uninstaller is a good idea.</p>
<p>Revo allows you to obliterate every trace of a program on your system. After running the built-in uninstaller, it scans for extra pieces. However, don&rsquo;t fret about the items that Revo finds in the Registry during the uninstall process. Cleaning the Registry is useless and you&rsquo;re better off leaving it alone to avoid damage. Paired up with our other tips, Revo is one part of a great offense against troublesome software that might be slowing down your system.</p>
<p><strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong></p>
<p>While solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming more popular, traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are still widely used. If you use an HDD, regular defragmentation can help keep the drive performing at its best.</p>
<p>The built-in Disk Defragmenter / Optimize Drives tool in Windows is all most people need for defragmentation. Simply click Analyze to find out how fragmented the drive is, then Defragment / Optimize to begin the process. Modern versions of Windows perform this process on a schedule automatically, so you won&rsquo;t need to manually run this utility.</p>
<p>windows-10-optimize-drives</p>
<p>If you have an SSD, you should not defragment your drive! Windows 7 and above actually perform trimming on SSDs from this menu, and won&rsquo;t even let you defragment an SSD. So if you see one listed, all is still well.</p>
<p><strong>Malwarebytes</strong></p>
<p>Often a slow system is caused by lack of maintenance, but sometimes the problem actually comes from malware. Having rogue programs running on your system can impair performance in many ways, such as browser hijackers that get in the way or programs that spawn endless pop-ups on your system.</p>
<p>Running a solid free antivirus will help prevent these infections in the future. When you&rsquo;re suffering from infection, however, download Malwarebytes Free and run a scan to sniff out anything malicious. As this junk wastes system resources and your time, purging your system of malware will get your computer running quickly again.</p>
