<p><strong>How to Set Up VPN in&nbsp;Windows</strong></p>
<p><small> </small>VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology lets a computer using a public Internet connection join a private network by way of a secure &ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; between that machine and the network. The most common case is a business allowing its employees to connect to its work network from home or from the road.</p>
<p>There are two principal ways to configure VPN. The first and more-common scenario, called <em>outgoing,</em> is setting up a remote computer to call into the office network.</p>
<p>The second scenario, called <em>incoming,</em> occurs on the network side, where a computer allows secure connections from other computers. Windows 7 comes preloaded with the Agile VPN client, which makes setting up either kind of connection relatively easy.</p>
<h3 class="subhed">Step by Step: Connecting to a VPN (Outgoing)</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Click the <em>Start</em> button. In the search bar, type <strong>VPN</strong> and then select <em>Set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Enter the IP address or domain name of the server to which you want to connect. If you&rsquo;re connecting to a work network, your IT administrator can provide the best address.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> If you want to set up the connection, but not connnect, select <em>Don&rsquo;t connect now</em>; otherwise, leave it blank and click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> On this next screen, you can either put in your username and password, or leave it blank. You&rsquo;ll be prompted for it again on the actual connection. Click <em>Connect</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> To connect, click on the Windows network logo on the lower-right part of your screen; then select <em>Connect</em> under VPN Connection.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> In the Connect VPN Connection box, enter the appropriate domain and your log-in credentials; then click <em>Connect</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> If you can&rsquo;t connect, the problem could be due to the server configuration. (There are different types of VPN.) Check with your network administrator to see what kind is in use&ndash;such as PPTP&ndash;then, on the Connect VPN Connection screen, select <em>Properties</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Navigate to the Security tab and select the specific Type of VPN from the drop-down list. You may also have to unselect <em>Include Windows logon domain</em>under the Options tab. Then click <em>OK</em> and<em>Connect</em>.</p>
<h3 class="subhed">Step by Step: Building a VPN (Incoming)</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Click the <em>Start</em> button, and, in the search bar, type <strong>Network and Sharing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Click <em>Change Adapter Settings</em> in the left-hand menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Click <em>File</em>, and then <em>New Incoming Connection</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Select the users you&rsquo;d like to give access to and click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Click <em>Through the Internet </em>and select <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> Select the Internet Protocol you&rsquo;d like to use. (The default TCP/IPv4&ndash;the line highlighted in the screenshot below&ndash;will work fine.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Finally, click <em>Allow access</em>; you&rsquo;ve now set up an incoming VPN connection.</p>
