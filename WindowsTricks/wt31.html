So we can shrink fascinating data from a drive and can create a new drive with shrunk space. For ex If we have the drive of 200Gb and it is approximately 80gb full with data and remaining 120 Gb is free, here we can shrink 100Gb and create a new drive. In this way, there will be two drives of 100Gb each.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Click <strong>Start</strong> and type &ldquo;<strong>disk mgmt.msg</strong>&rdquo; (without quotes) and press<strong>enter</strong>.Now a <strong>disk management</strong> window will appear.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp;</strong>Here you can see <strong>all your drives</strong> which are being currently available.&nbsp;<strong>Choose one</strong> of the drives which you want to shrink or extend. For<strong>shrinking a drive</strong> and<strong> creating a new</strong> one there must be some free space on that drive. Now right-click on the drive letter which you want to <strong>shrink</strong> Or take out free space. Now select <strong>shrink volume</strong>, &amp;&nbsp;a little process will go on.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.&nbsp;</strong>Here you will see the <strong>current size</strong> of the drive, free space and size which you want to shrink. Now <strong>enter</strong> the amount of space which you want to free, note that size should not exceed the free space. Now click <strong>shrink</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.&nbsp;</strong>In disk management window you will see an <strong>unallocated space</strong> at the right bottom corner. Right-click on it and select <strong>New Simple Volume</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.&nbsp;</strong>Now click <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Enter</strong> the size of drive you want to create and click next, next and last <strong>Finish.&nbsp;</strong>Now a New <strong>Volume or Drive</strong> will be created with the desired size.</p>
